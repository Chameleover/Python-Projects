# Web Newscraper

### by Filip Andonov, Bulgaria, Blagoevgrad

#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/s4nZ6pNX5j0
#### Description: 
This is a python project created for CS50P. It's main purpose is to scrape predefined news websites, gather articles by 
keywords and send them to user by demand.

I used different libraries to perform similar tasks, to enrich my knowledge. Firstly I extract web article's urls and 
titles with BeautifulSoup constructor from bs4 library. Then I use Article from newspaper library to get only article 
text. I check the text for each article for given keywords, and if found a match the article title and url are added to 
a dict. This dict is being converted to xlsx file, which is being converted to a html table and sent to given email address.
send_email.py sends an email using office356 server. sender's email & password, as well as receiver are stored in
creds.py file, for security purpose.

P.S Keywords are stored in csv file, and must be written manually before project's execution.

P.P.S in test_project.py can't be implemented hardcoded test cases as we used to do in the harvard homework projects, so
for now the file is with empty functions. Test cases will be implemented later

#### TODO:
- make class NewsPaper.
- create object for each website
- store news article in iterable data structure, and iterate over them to check for keywords
- if keyword found, add the article to a new dictionary.
- convert dictionary to html table, which could look good in email body
- send the output to given email
- error handling
- test cases
- add ignore case on keywords comparison




#### What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?
- web scraping; 
- getting article and links from parsed html; 
- converting dict to xlsx;
- converting xlsx to html table; 
- embedding html body in email; 
- send am email;


#### In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so itâ€™s not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope. What might you consider to be a good outcome for your project? A better outcome? The best outcome?
The deadline is 1 week (15 January). By then I must have a working version of the project, valid for CS50P certificate.
Later I would improve it by adding more websites and a mobile version.
