This is a python project for CS50P. It's main purpose is to scrape predefined news websites, gather articles by keywords and send them to user by demand.
First version will scrape only text-news and will be executed by .. HOW? ..

I used different libraries to perform similar tasks. Firstly I extract web article's urls and titles with BeautifulSoup
constructor from bs4 library. Then I use Article from newspaper library to get only article text. I check the text for
each article for given keywords, and if found a match the article title and url are added to a dict.
This dict is being converted to xlsx file, which is being converted to a html table and sent to given email address.



#What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

-getting article and links from parsed html; 
-converting dict to xlsx;
-converting xlsx to html table; 
-embedding html body in email; 
-send am email;


#In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so itâ€™s not uncommon to 
accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope. What might you consider to be a good outcome for your project? 
A better outcome? The best outcome?
The deadline is 1 week (15 January). By then I must have a working version of the project, valid for CS50P certificate.
Later I would improve it by adding mobile version, scraping videos as well, etc.
