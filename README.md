This is a python project for CS50P. It's main purpose is to scrape predefined news websites, gather articles by keywords and send them to user by demand.
First version will scrape only text-news and will be executed by .. HOW? ..


#What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?
I need to research web scraping, find a user-friendly way to execute the program, find a friendly way to store the output, and possibly find how to run it on a mobile device.

#If working with one or two classmates, who will do what?
#In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so itâ€™s not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope. What might you consider to be a good outcome for your project? A better outcome? The best outcome?
The deadline is 1 week (15 January). By then I must have a working version of the project, valid for CS50P certificate.
Later I would improve it by adding mobile version, scraping videos as well, etc.
